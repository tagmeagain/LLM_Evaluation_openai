- **What it measures**: Verbosity of response
- **Business Value**: 
  - Identify if model is too verbose or too terse
  - Balance completeness with conciseness
- **Interpretation**: Compare to business needs (concise vs detailed)

#### **Sentence Count**
- **Scale**: Count of sentences
- **What it measures**: Response structure granularity
- **Business Value**: 
  - More sentences = More structured breakdown
  - Fewer sentences = More concise
- **Interpretation**: Depends on use case

#### **Average Sentence Length**
- **Scale**: Words per sentence
- **What it measures**: Readability indicator
- **Business Value**: 
  - 10-15 words = Easy to read
  - 15-20 words = Standard
  - 20+ words = Complex, harder to read
- **CXO Talking Point**: "Optimal sentence length of 16 words ensures responses are easy to understand"

## 📈 Statistical Validation

### **P-value**
- **Meaning**: Probability that improvement is due to chance
- **Interpretation**:
  - p < 0.05 = **Statistically significant** (95% confidence)
  - p < 0.01 = **Highly significant** (99% confidence)
  - p ≥ 0.05 = Not statistically significant
- **CXO Talking Point**: "8 out of 10 improvements show p<0.05, proving these gains are real and reproducible, not random chance"

### **Improvement Percentage**
- **Calculation**: `((Fine-tuned - Base) / Base) × 100`
- **Interpretation**:
  - Positive = Fine-tuned model is better
  - Negative = Base model was better
  - Magnitude shows size of impact
- **CXO Talking Point**: "Average 23% improvement across quality metrics demonstrates clear ROI on fine-tuning investment"
